QML Box2D plugin
----------------

This plugin is meant to be installed to your Qt/imports directory, or shipped
in a directory of which the parent is added as import path.

The goal is to expose the functionality of Box2D as QML components, in order
to make it easy to write physics based games in QML.


INSTALLING - LINUX

 qmake
 make
 make install  (goes to Qt's import path, run with sudo if necessary)


RUNNING THE EXAMPLE

 qmlscene examples/boxes/boxes.qml


DEPLOYMENT

Support for deployment to mobile devices like the N900 and N8 is being worked
on.


USING QT CREATOR

For running you can use a "Custom Executable" configuration set to run
"qmlscene" with the right parameters.

When you have write permissions to Qt's import path, it can be convenient to
add a deployment step to your run settings:

 * Go to Projects -> box2d -> Run Settings
 * Choose Add Deploy Step -> Make
 * Enter "install" under "Make arguments"

This will make sure that before running, the version of the plugin is updated
in Qt's import path.


INSTALLING - OSX

1.  Open box2d.pro in Qt Creator
2.  Select the "Desktop Qt 5.4.0 clang 64bit" kit
3.  Click "Configure Project"
4.  Choose "Projects" from the sidebar
5.  Select menu item "Build" -> "Rebuild All"
6.  Wait for building of the debug library to complete
7.  Change the build type from "Debug" to "Release"
8.  Select menu item "Build" -> "Rebuild All"
9.  Wait for building of the release library to complete
10. Create this folder "/Applications/Qt5.4.0/5.4/clang_64/qml/Box2D". You will need adjust this path if your Qt installation is in a different location.
11. Copy the file qmldir from the "qml-box2d" folder into your new "Box2D" folder
12. Copy the file libBox2D_debug.dylib from your "Debug Build directory" into your new "Box2D" folder
13. Copy the file libBox2D.dylib from your "Release Build directory" into your new "Box2D" folder
14. Done, you can now use Box2D in your desktop based QML projects
